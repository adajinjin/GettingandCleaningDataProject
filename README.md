# GettingandCleaningDataProject
This is a repo for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data
The script "run_analysis.R" was created to download, load, and process the data from website:
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

The process contains 5 steps as illustrated in the project statement as well as comments in the script.
The final tidy data was created as a text file and used to upload to the course website.
